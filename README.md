 #### This project is made to allow you to have your own kofujs powered template generator locally for building SPA's and Universal Apps

# To start
1. run ``` npm i create-kofujs-app -g ```  will add the project globally onto your computer
2. from the command line run ``` create-kofujs-app ``` in the parent folder that you desire the project to be in.
3. You will select kofujs which is the only current template more to come soon
4. It will ask your project name that will be the name of your folder
5. Feel awesome
6. Write your components in the src folder, don't delete templates
7. In order to use app effectively you need to install ```yarn package manager``` and ```gulp-cli```  globally.  I also still love CoffeeScript so I use it from time to time in the source code, i am also thinking of integrating `typed coffee` and building on top of the great work that was done there. I will also be using ```Crystal Lang with Amber``` as the defacto backend and ```Koa``` as the default JS Full Stack Application.
